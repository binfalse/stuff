# stuff.

In this repository I collect code, scripts, snippets, configuration, ... that don't fit somewhere else and do not justify a seperate repository. Most of the stuff is supplemental material for my blog at [binfalse.de](http://binfalse.de).

Feel free to have a look into the different directories. If you're lucky you'll find some documentation or a link to a website ;-)
